# MCP3008 Prometheus Exporter

## Overview

WIP

This project provides a Prometheus exporter for the MCP3008, an 8-channel, 10-bit analog to digital converter (ADC). This exporter reads the output from each channel on the MCP3008 and exposes these readings as Prometheus metrics via integers ranging from 0 to 1023.
